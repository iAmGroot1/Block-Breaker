# Brick-Breaker
This is my attempt at making a brick breaker game which was one of the first games i had played in my childhood. This game is not as refined as it should be it doesnt have any levels as such. The aim of the game is to finish destroying all the bricks without letting the ball fall below the paddle. 

## Setup
- The code is written in java and thus you need an environmet which supports java.
- For the audio you need to download the audio file you prefer though it should be in **WAV** format also you need to change the file pathway in the audio class.
